## Installation
	pip install apiverve-colorsimilaritycalculator

---

## Configuration

Before using the colorsimilarity API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

---

## Usage

The Color Similarity Calculator API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/colorsimilarity](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/colorsimilarity).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```
# Import the client module
from apiverve_colorsimilaritycalculator.apiClient import ColorsimilarityAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = ColorsimilarityAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")
```

---


### Perform Request
Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```
query = { "color1": "FF5733", "color2": "FF6B47" }
```

###### Simple Request

```
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```
